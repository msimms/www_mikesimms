<h2>Definition</h2>
Like a scale, a mode is also an ordered series of musical pitches that are played in order. The difference is that modes are constructed from notes that are diatonic to a particular scale. In other words, modes are derived by using the notes from a particular scale and then changing the order of the notes to emphasize a different root.<br>

<h2>Ionian</h2>
The Ionian mode is built on the first degree of the major scale and hence is identical to the major scale.<br>
<br>
C Ionian:<br>
c-d-e-f-g-a-b-c<br>

<h2>Dorian</h2>
The Dorian mode is built from the second degree of the major scale due to the flattened third interval. The dorian mode is often used when soloing in a minor key. The major 6th gives it a bluesy quality and makes it a good alternative to the aeolian mode which does not sound as bright.<br>
<br>
D Dorian:<br>
d-e-f-g-a-b-c-d<br>

<h2>Phrygian</h2>
The Phrygian mode is built from the third degree of the major scale.<br>
<br>
E Phrygian:<br>
e-f-g-a-b-c-d-e<br>

<h2>Lydian</h2>
The Lydian mode is built from the fourth degree of the major scale. It's tonality is major the only difference between the Lydian mode and major scale is a raised 4th interval. In popular music the Lydian mode has been used to convey a sense of mystery or wonder.<br>
<br>
F Lydian:<br>
f-g-a-b-c-d-e-f<br>

<h2>Mixolydian</h2>
The Mixolydian mode is built from the fifth degree of the major scale.<br>
<br>
G Mixolydian:<br>
g-a-b-c-d-e-f-g<br>

<h2>Aeolian</h2>
The Aeolian mode is built from the six degree of the major scale and is identical to the relative minor of the major scale. For example, Am is the relative minor of C major.<br>
<br>
A Aeolian:<br>
a-b-c-d-e-f-g-a<br>

<h2>Locrian</h2>
The Locrian mode is built from the seventh degree of the major scale.<br>
<br>
B Locrian:<br>
b-c-d-e-f-g-a-b<br>

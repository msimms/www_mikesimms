<h2>Gear</h2>
The Edge uses numerous guitars both live and in the studio. However, he is well known for favoring his Gibson Explorer. His effects rig is a subject of much discussion amongst guitar players due to his signature use of the delay effect. In brief, Edge splits the signal at the end of his effects chain and routes it to two digital delay units and ultimately to two Vox amplifiers.<br>

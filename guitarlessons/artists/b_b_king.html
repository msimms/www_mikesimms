<h1 align="center">B.B. King</h1>

<h2>Gear</h2>
B.B. King is known for playing Gibson ES-355s, all of them affectionately known as Lucille. H uses a Lab System amp on which he dials in a very clean sound. The Lab System is a 2 x 12 style amplifier that was discontinued many years ago. The closest thing to it on the market today is the Fender Twin Reverb.<br>

<h2>Playing Style</h2>
B.B. King plays lead guitar almost exclusively and even admits to having a poor knowledge of chords and rhythm playing. In general, his style is based around the use of major and minor pentatonic scales with added blue notes. He favors the scale box that is presented below:<br>
<br>
A Blues<br>
<font face="monospace">
e -8-9-10----------<br>
b -8---10-11-------<br>
g ---9-10----------<br>
d -----------------<br>
a -----------------<br>
e -----------------<br>
</font>
<br>
King is also known for the manner in which he applies vibrato to a note. He uses a technique he invented while trying to imitate the sound made by a bottle slide. This technique is likened to turning a door knob, meaning the hand is rocked in a circular motion around the index finger or whichever finger is fretting the note. Though he most commonly applies this vibrato technique to the index finger he will use whichever finger is most appropriate based on the position in which he is playing. During an interview with <a href="http://www.guitar.com">guitar.com</a>, King mentioned that he favors down strokes as opposed to alternate picking as he can judge the attack more accurately on the down stroke than with the upstroke notes.<br>
